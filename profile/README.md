# Jappe OS
## About
JappeOS is a fresh, Linux-based OS that’s all about being lightweight, easy to use, and fast. Whether you’ve got a budget laptop or a powerhouse PC, JappeOS is designed to run smoothly on pretty much any device.

The cool thing about JappeOS is what’s under the hood. We use Dart and Flutter to build the desktop environment and apps, which means it looks awesome and runs fast. And since we use Wayland for display management, you get super smooth visuals and great performance.

If you’re into trying out new systems or just need something simple for day-to-day stuff, JappeOS has got you covered.

> [!WARNING]
> JappeOS is still in very early development. It is not ready for daily use yet. You can get updates and devlogs on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/dRtU4HR).

## Key Features
